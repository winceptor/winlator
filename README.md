# Useful Tips

- If you are experiencing performance issues, try changing the Box86/Box64 preset in Container Settings -> Advanced Tab.
- For applications that use .NET Framework, try installing Wine Mono found in Start Menu -> System Tools.
- If some older games don't open, try adding the environment variable MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR=2003 in Container Settings -> Environment Variables.
- Try running the games using the shortcut on the Winlator home screen, there you can define individual settings for each game.
- To speed up the installers, try changing the Box86/Box64 preset to Intermediate in Container Settings -> Advanced Tab.
